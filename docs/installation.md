# How I install Arch Linux

## Introduction

This is a guide on how I install Arch Linux. It is not the only way to install Arch Linux, but it is the way that I have found to be the most efficient and reliable. This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of Linux and the command line. If you are new to Linux, I recommend reading the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) before proceeding.
